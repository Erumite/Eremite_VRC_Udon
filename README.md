# Eremite's VRChat Stuff - Udon Edition

This repo is here to contain a bunch of VRChat related notes, prefabs and demos.  It serves both as a way of storing notes for myself and for showing friends/fellow creators how I go about certain things.

There are various `README.md` files sprinkled around the repo that have more information about the specific folder.  Please refer to them for more detail.

For SDK2 stuff, see the [old repo here](https://github.com/Erumite/Eremite_VRC), though keep in mind it's no longer maintained and SDK2 will likely be deprecated in the future.

#### You will need:
* VRChat SDK 3.0 - https://vrchat.com/home/download
* UdonSharp - https://github.com/MerlinVR/UdonSharp
* UdonToolkit - https://github.com/orels1/UdonToolkit

#### How do I use this?
I tend to not make unity packages for this stuff, so cloning the repo and importing the `Assets/Eremite` directory will probably be sufficient.

You can probably also just clone this repo to a folder and open it as a new project in Unity.  Things might get a little screwy if the requirements are missing, so you would probably want to copy them from another project first.

Once that's sorted, you can just do a git pull for updates.
