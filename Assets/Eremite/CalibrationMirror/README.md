# Calibration Mirror

Super basic timed mirror with a slider to visualize time remaining.

* Configurable active time.
* Only shows the local player's mirror reflection.
* Slider counts down before deactivating the mirror.

Made for events where people might need access to a mirror to calibrate full-body, but a group of mirror-dwellers is undesirable.
