# World Camera Drone

A drone you can fly around and explore a world with.  Includes various toggleable features.

* Homing Mode (Return to controller)
* Night Vision
* Spotlight

This uses a configurable joint rather than a rotation constraint because the movement feels much nicer.  For peak performance, you could replace the config joint with a Rotation constraint, but the difference is probably negligible.

Ported from my old [SDK2 Version](https://github.com/Erumite/Eremite_VRC/tree/master/Assets/Eremite/WorldObjects/FlyingDrone) into Udon.
