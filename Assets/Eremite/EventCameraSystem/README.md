[Demo World](https://vrchat.com/home/launch?worldId=wrld_b1536ede-7068-4834-a844-2bf4f0202369&instanceId=0)

A method of handling the main camera angle for podcast recording, concerts and more.

Inspired by [Scyne](https://www.twitch.tv/scynewave)'s camera system for his podcast. (check it out)  
Created for handling the Cameras and FX for [Nyx's Abyss](https://www.twitch.tv/nyxsabyss) concerts.

For a way to capture the MainCam output for streaming or recording, see the [Streaming Station](/Assets/Eremite/StreamingStation).

#### ToDo:
* Alternate Transitions: Only one type active at once.
  * Screen Wipe between old/new cam - use Preview rendertex for OldCam to avoid performance hit of two cameras.
